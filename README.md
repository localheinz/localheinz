:wave:

My name is Andreas MÃ¶ller, and I am a self-employed Software Engineer and Consultant from Berlin, Germany.

I have been developing software for more than 25 years. In a professional capacity, I have [more than ten years of work experience](https://localheinz.com/work-experience/) building and maintaining web applications for organizations and businesses in a range of industries, in teams small and large, on location and remotely.

I maintain open-source projects in the [@ergebnis](https://github.com/ergebnis) organization, contribute to a wide range of [open-source projects](https://github.com/localheinz?tab=repositories&q=&type=fork&language=), and regularly attend [community events](https://localheinz.com/events/).

Occasionally, I write [articles](https://localheinz.com/articles/).

With a focus on helping teams to modernize existing web applications and to build maintainable, well-tested software, I can help you ship software earlier, with fewer defects, and with a lower total cost of ownership - so your business can be more profitable.
