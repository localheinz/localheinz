## :wave: Hello!

My name is Andreas MÃ¶ller, and I am a self-employed Software Engineer and Consultant from Berlin, Germany.

For more than 25 years, I have been developing software. In a professional capacity, I have [more than 15 years of work experience](https://localheinz.com/work-experience/) building and maintaining web applications for organizations and businesses in various industries, in teams small and large, on location, and remotely.

I maintain and contribute to [open-source](https://localheinz.com/open-source/) projects, publish [articles](https://localheinz.com/articles/), and give [talks](https://localheinz.com/talks).

With a focus on modernizing legacy applications and teams, I can help your business become more profitable: by shipping software earlier, with fewer defects, and with a lower total cost of ownership.
